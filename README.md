# Duck Hunt - The Reckoning! üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeBlooded


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Fayiz Muhammad
- Member 2: Fawaz Basheer

### Project Description
An over-the-top parody of the classic Duck Hunt. You shoot ducks on a retro-styled CRT canvas, but the ducks resurrect, mock you with taunts, and retaliate by firing eggs at your crosshair. Endless rounds escalate difficulty, with chiptune beeps, hit flashes, yolk splats, and a very unhelpful dog.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Classic duck games don‚Äôt prepare you for the harsh reality of immortal, vengeful waterfowl who can aim back. Also, there‚Äôs never enough yolk on the screen.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Make the ducks resurrect, taunt you with little signs, and throw eggs at your cursor while a happy tune abruptly switches to a minor key. Add a CRT overlay, hit flashes, fake highscores, and a dog that shrugs at your misery. Problem solved.
